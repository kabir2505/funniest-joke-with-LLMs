### Joke 1

```text

### Joke 2

```text
You know, debugging Node.js in a VM is wild. It's like forcing a rock star to perform in a telephone booth. The code's like, "Dude, I need some headroom!  Give me more RAM, I need to *shred*!
```

### Joke 3

```text
Node.js trapped in a VM is like a kid who learned all the internet slang but never met another human. It's sending packets like love letters, hoping for a response...but its callback hell is so deep, it might as well be waiting for Atlantis to call.
